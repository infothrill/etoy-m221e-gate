This is a quick hack to implement the m221e gate as discussed during the GM2009
in Heiligkreuz.

Because of resource restrictions, agent.POL stepped in to implement a web
frontend for uploading files.

This is implemented in Python (2.4) using Turbogears (1.0) as the framework.

These tools can be installed in a HOME directory and function as a complete
webserver without needing the "rest of the system".
